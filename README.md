# Project
This project classifies fashion items using CNN.

**Overview**

This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can automatically classify fashion items such as shirts, shoes, bags, and dresses. Using the Fashion MNIST dataset, the model learns to identify clothing categories based on image features, demonstrating the power of deep learning in image recognition tasks.

**Dataset**

Name: Fashion MNIST

Total Images: 70,000 (60,000 training + 10,000 testing)

Classes (10): T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot

Image Size: 28×28 pixels (grayscale)

**Tech Stack**

Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

**Model Architecture**

Convolutional + ReLU Layers

MaxPooling Layers

Flatten Layer

Dense Layers

Softmax Output Layer (10 classes)

**Results**

Training Accuracy: ~92%

Test Accuracy: ~89%

The model successfully classifies fashion images into their respective categories.

**Applications**
